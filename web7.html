        <h2>Description</h2>
        Bal Ganesh (transl. Little Ganesh) is a 2007 computer-animated musical feature film directed by Pankaj Sharma. The film is about the adventures and hijinks of Lord Ganesh, the Hindu elephant-headed god, when he was a kid.
        Shiva and Parvati live on Mount Kailash. One day, Parvati asks Nandi to guard the palace and prevent any visitors from coming in while she takes her bath. Shiva enters the palace anyways, which upsets Parvati. She wants an attendant of her own who would obey her above all else. While she is bathing, she creates a mold from sandalwood paste. Her love and prayers give the mold life, and he comes to life as Ganesh. As a child, Ganesh is playful, engaging in mischief with Nandi.

       One day, Parvati asks Ganesh to guard the palace while she bathes, and he promises not to let anybody in. When Shiva comes by, Ganesh does not allow him in because he will not disobey his mother under any circumstances. Even Brahma is unable to get Ganesh to budge. Shiva begins his tandava in extreme anger. From the ocean, Vishnu and Lakshmi decide to go to Kailash to calm Shiva down. They arrive to Kailash just as Shiva cuts off Ganesh's head with his trident.
